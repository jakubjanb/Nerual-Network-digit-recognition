# Nerual-Network-digit-recognition
In this project, we compare the effectiveness of the Decision Tree method with a simple Neural Network for digit recognition.
Then we test how adding hidden layers with a different number of hidden cells affects the program's effectiveness.
We observe an increase in the accuracy of digit recognition with the increase in the complexity of the network since more layers give the network more power to express complex concepts.
